Project Details:

1) Data Science Bowl 2017:
It is an online project hosted on Kaggle.com. The aim is to extract relevant information from real life datasets (in this case DICOM chest scans for patients) and help derive a model which can predict lung cancer. The model was built from scratch involving a lot of pre-processing and data mining techniques.

2) MaleFemale:
The aim was to do real-time video analysis using OpenCV. This script would identify Male and Female faces in real time and display the counters on the video stream.

3) Style Transfer-Winter Training:
As part of my Winter Training project, I implemented the Style Transfer algorithm in TensorFlow. It takes a content image and a style image as input and produces an image having same content as the content image but painted in the style of the style image.

4) Stock Market Predictor:
It uses Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm (Support Vector Machine) to predict if a stock will underperform or over perform with respect to the market. SVM was trained upon by a decade worth of data from each of the S&P 500 companies.

5) Octave Projects:
These include the projects I made during my Coursera course for Machine Learning by Andrew Ng.

6) Webparser:
My simple use of BeautifulSoup python library for web-scraping.
